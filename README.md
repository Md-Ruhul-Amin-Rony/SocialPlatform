# Clean Architecture

## Clean Architecture Overview

Clean Architecture, introduced by Robert Martin, emphasizes a structured approach to building applications, with a focus on separation of concerns and maintainability. The architecture is based on several key principles:

## Dependency Rule
- Dependencies are encapsulated within each ring of the architecture.
- Each layer depends only on the layers closer to the center, keeping important business rules isolated.

## Layers
### Entities (Domain Layer):
- Contains business logic common to all applications.
- Represents core business entities, such as activities in our case.

### Use Cases (Application Layer):
- Encapsulates all business logic and implements use cases.
- Each use case is represented by a class and handler.
- Completely isolated from the user interface, allowing flexibility in UI implementation.

### Interface Adapters (API Layer):
- Acts as a connector between business logic and framework-specific code.
- Includes API controllers, which retrieve information from the application layer.

### Frameworks and Drivers:
- Outer layer containing the user interface and database.
- Clean architecture principles ensure independence from specific frameworks and databases.

## Flow of Control
- Application layer responsible for processing business logic.
- Mediator pattern used for handling communication between API controllers and application layer.

## Recommendations
- Architecture should be independent from frameworks, interfaces, and databases.
- Business logic should be testable and independent from external elements.
- Flexibility to change UI or database implementations without modifying core business logic.


## Project Structure
**API:**
-Contains controllers and middleware.
Acts as the interface adapter, connecting business logic to framework-specific code.

**Application:**
-Houses CQRS handlers and Mediator implementations.
Implements business logic and use cases, independent of UI considerations.

**Domain:**
-Defines entities and encapsulates core business logic.
Contains essential business objects, such as activities.

**Infrastructure:**
-Handles data access and external services.
Includes implementations of data repositories and external integrations.

**Persistence:**
-Houses the EF Core Data Context.
Provides data persistence functionality using Entity Framework Core.

**client-app:**
-React application for the front end.
Contains components, features, layout, models, stores, and routing logic.
